Welcome to the ZanuiFixturesBundle!
===================================

This bundle defines abstract fixture classes to load test data into a database.
It complements the DoctrineFixturesBundle_ by extending and implementing
classes from the `Doctrine2 Data Fixtures library`_ to ease the pain of loading
data fixtures programmatically into the Doctrine ORM. Please read the
documentation_ for that bundle first to get familiar with the basic concepts that
we will build upon.
